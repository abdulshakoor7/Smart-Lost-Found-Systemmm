🎓 Smart Lost & Found System for Campus

An AI-Powered Asset Recovery Ecosystem for the University of Gujrat (UOG)

Flutter Django TensorFlow PostgreSQL

🚀 Overview

The Smart Lost & Found System is a full-stack, cross-platform solution designed
to automate asset recovery within academic environments. Traditionally,
universities rely on manual logbooks or unorganized social media groups. This
system introduces Artificial Intelligence to automatically categorize items and
a Weighted Heuristic Matching Engine to connect finders with owners in
real-time.

🛠 Technical Architecture

The system utilizes a Decoupled 3-Tier Architecture:

1.  Frontend (Flutter): A single codebase for Android and Web utilizing
    Material 3 design and Provider state management.
2.  Backend (Django REST): A Python-based logic layer handling AI inference,
    matching algorithms, and SMTP email services.
3.  Database (Polyglot Persistence):
      - PostgreSQL: For relational data integrity (Claims, Items, Audit Logs).
      - Firebase: For real-time chat synchronization and cloud messaging.

✨ Key Features

  - AI Image Recognition: Automatically extracts item category and color labels
    using MobileNetV2.
  - Weighted Matching: Similarity scoring (Score \ge 60\%) based on AI tags,
    keywords, and location.
  - Real-time Synchronization: Instant chat and notifications via Firebase
    Firestore/FCM.
  - Administrative Oversight: A mediated verification protocol for security
    staff to audit claims.
  - Privacy Guard: Conditional visibility for personal contact details.
